## 🧩 Addon Updates (2026-02-12)

**Damage Meter Nudge** — v1.2.0  

**Changes:**  
- Converted the addon into a **minimal “unlock” tool** instead of a nudge/positioning addon.  
- Damage meter windows are no longer repositioned or overridden in any way.  
- The addon now focuses only on removing Blizzard’s restrictive clamping/insets, allowing Edit Mode to move the meter closer to the screen edge.

**Fixes:**  
- Fixed an issue where earlier versions could interfere with **Edit Mode resizing** for Damage Meter Window 1.

**Known issues:**  
- None currently known.
