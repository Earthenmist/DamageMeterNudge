# DamageMeterNudge

A lightweight World of Warcraft addon that **unlocks Blizzard’s new Damage Meter windows**, allowing you to move them **flush to the screen edge** using Edit Mode — without breaking resizing.

This addon does **not** replace Edit Mode or force custom positioning.  
It simply removes Blizzard’s restrictive clamping / inset limits.

---

## ✨ Features
- Unlocks Blizzard’s Damage Meter windows so they can be moved closer to the screen edge
- Works fully with **Edit Mode** (including width/height resizing)
- Supports **all 3 damage meter windows**
- Minimal, lightweight, and safe (no UI, no constant repositioning)
- No dependencies

---

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Enable the addon
2. Open **Edit Mode**
3. Select the Damage Meter window
4. Move it normally — you can now push it closer to the screen edge
